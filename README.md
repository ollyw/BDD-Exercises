#BDD-Exercises

**N.B. This is a work in progress**

This repository holds some katas that help refine the way that I do BDD.

Some of the areas that it should highlight are:


- The right level of abstraction when writing tests
- Focusing on iterative design with Red-Green-Refactor
- Driving tests from the business domain
- Use of BDD tools
